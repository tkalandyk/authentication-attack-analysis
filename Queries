# 🔐 Authentication Attack Analysis — Investigation Queries

This document contains the KQL queries used during the investigation of abnormal authentication activity on the internet-exposed Windows VM **js-mde-test**.  
Each query represents a deliberate investigative pivot used to validate or disprove compromise following suspected brute-force authentication activity.

**Purpose:**  
Identify the volume of failed logon attempts targeting the device to determine whether brute-force or password-guessing behavior occurred.

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where DeviceName contains "js-mde-test"
| summarize FailedLogons = count() by DeviceName

</details>

Why this matters:
A high number of failed logons against an exposed endpoint is a strong indicator of brute-force or credential-stuffing activity.
